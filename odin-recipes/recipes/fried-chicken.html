    <h2>I put my word on it this is the best fried chicken recipe. Its my recipe by the way.</h2>
    <p>Chances are you already have most if not all the ingredients for this recipe in your kitchen. This is a very simple yet delicious recipe.
        This recipe is good for fried chicken nuggets, wings, sandwiches, tenders, ect. I am not sure how well it would work in an air fryer because I dont own one.
    </p>
    <p>I know this is just a practice website but in all seriousness I highly reccomend trying this recipe out. You will not be dissapointed. This rescipe is
        desgined to work for two chicken breasts but I would highly reccomend doubling it for two sets of chicken breast because youll wish you had more.
